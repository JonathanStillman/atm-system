# ATM System using C++

## Overview
In this program, the user is presented with four options - check balance, withdraw cash, deposit cash, or quit. The user enters their choice, and based on the input, the program performs the corresponding action. If the user selects the "Withdraw Cash" option, they are prompted to enter the amount they want to withdraw. If the user's account balance is insufficient, the program will display a message informing the user that they do not have sufficient funds. Similarly, if the user selects the "Deposit Cash" option, they are prompted to enter the amount they want to deposit. Finally, if the user selects the "Quit" option, the program will terminate.

## Recommended Setup
IntelliJ / Eclipse / Visual Studio Code
